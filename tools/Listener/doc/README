The GoboLinux Listener
----------------------

Listener is a daemon which watchs for events on /Programs. When a binary 
package is saved/moved/created there, Listener invokes InstallPackage and 
voilà, the package gets installed with no user's interaction. And for
managing broken links, Listener cleans up /System/Links if an entry is
removed from /Programs, keeping the filesystem tree always clean.

Of course the entries to look at and the actions to take when something
happens there is flexible. Just look at listener.conf for explanation on
how to configure it.

This application is based on inotify, a great notification event which's 
going to deprecate dnotify (fcntl). In order for inotify to work you need
a recent kernel version, which can be guaranteed on GoboLinux by running
'Compile Linux'.
